• A major difference is that containers do not require their own full-blown OS. In fact, all containers on a single host share the host’s OS. This frees up huge amounts of system resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage. It also reduces potential licensing costs and reduces the overhead of OS patching and other maintenance.

• Containers are also fast to start and ultra-portable. It’s vital to understand that a running container shares the kernel of the host machine it is running on.

• A containerized app is an application running as a container.
